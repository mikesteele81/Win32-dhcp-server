-- |Many DHCP functions return a large object composed of pointers to other
--  objects. When it comes time to clean up memory we need to walk through
--  the structure. This helper function calls an action to get a pointer
--  to free (usually a variant of peek), and then calls the supplied free
--  action on it. Finally, the pointer is zeroed out.
